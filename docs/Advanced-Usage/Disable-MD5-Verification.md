# 🔓 Disable MD5 Verification

MOS performs MD5 checksum verification on boot to ensure data integrity
from `image`, `rootfs` and `drivers` files in /boot directory during boot.
In advanced scenarios, this verification can be explicitly disabled.

### 🛠️ How to Disable MD5 Checks

- Create the following file on the system:

```text
  /boot/config/system/md5check_disabled
```

- The file may be empty or contain any content

- The existence of the file alone is sufficient


- Once this file exists, MD5 verification is completely disabled

---

:::warning Important Notes
- Disabling MD5 checks is intended for advanced users only
- Use this option only if you fully understand the implications
:::

## ✅ Summary

- MD5 verification can be disabled via a marker file

- File path: /boot/config/system/md5check_disabled

- File content is irrelevant

- Recommended only for special scenarios
